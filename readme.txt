Matlab code of the Grandi et al. human atrial model.

This model was developed by incorporating the experimentally known atrio-ventricular differences into
the Grandi-Pasqualini-Bers human ventricular model (also available for download in this website).
Parameters were also tuned to recapitulate action potential and Ca handling characteristics of chronic
atrial fibrillation.
